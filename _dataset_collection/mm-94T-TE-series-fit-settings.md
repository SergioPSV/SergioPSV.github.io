developer: Tamas Borbath
type: mm, svs
abstract: This are TE series (TE = 24,32,40,52,60 ms) DIR semi-LASER macromolecular spectra. They were measured in the occipital lobe (in GM rich and WM voxels) of the human brain. The provided data are averages from 11 subjects. Additionally, the fitsettings and sample fits are provided. An explanation on how to set up the fit settings file is provided in the Readme.MD.
