abstract: This repository contains the LCModel quantifications of 9.4T spectra acquired in hippocampus from 7 rats. The spectra were quntified using six different DKNTMN (spline stiffness) values (0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 1, 5). In the folder Control_files_Basis_set you can find all the control files used in this quantification along with the corresponding basis set (metabolites/simulated using NMRScopeB from jMRUI and in vivo parameters + full MM spectrum).
