developer: Karl Landheer, Christoph Juchem
abstract: "Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the relationship between CRLB and SD for all fitted parameters from linear combination modeling. More details about the acquisition can be found in the reference below."
format: .mat file (readable in MATLAB). Synthetic spectra were generated from MARSS, fitting was performed in INSPECTOR. Both MARSS and INSPECTOR are based in MATLAB.
type: svs
sequence: Synthesized spectra were simulated for a TE = 20.1 ms sLASER sequence
