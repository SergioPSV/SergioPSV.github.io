name: Basis sets for PRESS, STEAM and sLASER for multiple vendors
image:
developer: Karl Landheer, Kelley Swanberg, Christoph Juchem
type: svs, basisset
abstract: "These basis sets were generated using the exact waveforms, timings and 128^3 spatial points to appropriately accommodate the sidebands for each vendor/sequence combination. More details about the acquisition can be found in the reference below."
format: Both .RAW and .mat (INSPECTOR, readable in MATLAB) are provided. All files were generated using MATLAB
sequence: PRESS, sLASER, STEAM
