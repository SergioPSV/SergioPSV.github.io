abstract: "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Data acquired in 9 healthy volunteers using a SPECIAL Localization with three different adiabatic inversion pulses (hyperbolic secant, WURST, GOIA) at a 7T Magnetom whole-body system (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). Every volunteer was examined 4 times (twice on day one including a repositioning between the measurements, and twice on day two a week later without repositioning between alike measurements) to investigate the repeatability and reproducibility.
