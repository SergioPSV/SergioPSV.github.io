abstract: "This dataset consists of PRESS data acquired before and after running a heavy gradient duty fMRI sequence using standardized protocols for GE, Philips and Siemens scanners.
1) Pre-fMRI PRESS (TR/TE = 5000/35 ms; FA = 90°; 64 transients; no water suppression; voxel size = 2 × 2 × 2 cm3; second-order shim; scan duration = 5:20 min);
2) BOLD-weighted EPI based on the ADNI-3 protocol (Weiner et al., 2017) (TR/TE = 3000/30 ms; 197 dynamics; EPI factor/echo train length = 31/64, duration = 10 min);
-3) Post-fMRI PRESS (same parameters as for pre-fMRI PRESS except 360 transients and duration = 30 min)."
