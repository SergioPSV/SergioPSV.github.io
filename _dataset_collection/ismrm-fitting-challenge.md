abstract: "Synthetic data mimicking single-voxel 3 T PRESS TE = 30 ms MRS spectra. Data were simulated using ideal pulses and the known metabolites concentrations in the human brain. The experimentally acquired macromolecular contribution was also used. The following things were modulated in the datasets: non-Lorentzian broadening, concentrations of GABA, GSH and macromolecules, signal-to-noise (SNR) variations, and artifacts. These data was used in the Fitting Challenge organized as part of the ISMRM Workshop on MR Spectroscopy: From Current Best Practice to Latest Frontiers, Lake Constance, Germany, 2016."
