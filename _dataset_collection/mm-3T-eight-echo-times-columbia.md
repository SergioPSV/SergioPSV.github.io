abstract: Metabolite-nulled macromolecules spectra acquired from 10 healthy young volunteers scanned at 3 T using double-inversion recovery semi-LASER sequence with 8 echo times (20 - 62 ms) from two brain regions (prefrontal and occipital). Voxel-specific segmented brain values are included in Excel spreadsheet. More details about the acquisition can be found in the reference below.
