**UKRIN Kidney Analysis Toolbox (UKAT)**

*A Framework for Harmonized Quantitative Renal MRI Analysis*


### Summary

Multicentre validation studies are key to the clinical translation of renal MRI and as such, the development of harmonised, cross vendor protocols is crucial.  To process data acquired from these protocols, the *UK Renal Imaging Network Kidney Analysis Toolbox (UKAT)* has been developed. This open-source, vendor agnostic and easy to use Python package can be used for image registration, field mapping, relaxometry and diffusion mapping.  UKATs combination of robust software, documented methodological decisions and easy to follow tutorials means we envisage this as a useful tool for the renal and abdominal imaging community.
