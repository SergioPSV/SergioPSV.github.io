type: analysis processing visualization mrsi
abstract: "The MIDAS software consists of several modules for MRSI reconstruction, display, and analysis. It is closely associated with the volumetric EPSI sequence that we make available for Siemens MR systems.
MIDAS is written in IDL, but also uses Java and C functions. It can be run using a free IDL license (with some limitations). A binary installation can be obtained from the web site and all source code is available from the developers on request."
language: IDL
