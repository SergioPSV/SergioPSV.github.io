developer: Martijn Froeling, PhD
type: analysis processing visualization
abstract: "QMRITools is written in Mathematica using Wolfram Workbench and Eclipse and contains a collection of tools and functions for processing quantitative MRI data.

The software tools for spectroscopy are mostly focussed on 31P CSI analysis but do not exclude other nuclei and/or acquistion methods. The basic features include methods for manipulating and processing spectra (including PCA denoising and deconvolution), generation of basis spectra using j-coupling simulations and fitting of basis spectra to the spectra."

Name of software: QMRITools
Abstract: QMRITools is written in Mathematica using Wolfram Workbench and Eclipse and contains a collection of tools and functions for processing quantitative MRI data.
The software tools for spectroscopy are mostly focussed on 31P CSI analysis but do not exclude other nuclei and/or acquistion methods. The basic features include methods for
manipulating and processing spectra (including PCA denoising and deconvolution), generation of basis spectra using j-coupling simulations and fitting of basis spectra to the spectra.
Languages: Mathematica
