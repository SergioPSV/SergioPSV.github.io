abstract: VDI (Visual Display Interface) is a collection of MATLAB libraries created to visualize and process multiresolution data, such as MRS, MRSI, fMRI and anatomical MRI. An additional sub-library called SpinTool (independently available for download) can be used to easily and quickly write Bloch simulations and simulations of J-coupled spins.
