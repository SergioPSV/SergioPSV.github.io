# How to access code

You can browse the various software packages by clicking on a topic in the column to the left. Each topic takes you to a list of associated software packages.

Links in each package entry will take you to either an external web site (typical for applications that already have a website) or to various GitHub repositories that 'live' on the MRSHub.

You don’t have to be familiar with GitHub to download code from this site. Three quick clicks and you can have a ZIP file downloaded to your computer:

1. Pick/click a topic in the list to the left.

2. Find a package entry that has an ['MRSHub Code']() link at the bottom (circled in red). Click on this link.

3. You are now taken to the GitHub repository front page. Click on the green 'Clone or download' button (circled in green) to download a `.ZIP` file containing all the files in the repository to your computer.

4. Alternatively, you can just browse the directories and files directly by clicking on a directory or file link (circled in purple).

However, if Git is your thing, feel free to fork and clone to your heart’s content. Enjoy!
