## Vision
For many, the impression of a committee is "a (dis)organized group that keeps minutes and loses hours". In this endeavor, we strive to be better than described by this rather low hanging bar.  

## Purpose
We will provide the MRS community with online resources in which to share and communicate in the hope that no one in our field will ever again have to ‘reinvent a wheel’.  

## Deliverables
We will provide online resources to the MRS community to enable:  

* Sharing of working and well documented code snippets and/or libraries
* Sharing of well documented example data
* A forum in which to discuss topics of interest to the group in a mannerly fashion

## Committee Structure

* This committee will be a standing committee under the authority of the ISMRM MRS Study Group.  

* It will consist of six members who will serve for two years.  

* Three members will rotate on/off the committee each year to provide continuity of expertise.  

* Committee members will be appointed by the officers of the MRS Study Group executive committee yearly at the ISMRM meeting, or at another time of their designation.  

* A committee member may leave the committee at any time during their tenure by notifying the MRS Study Group executive committee of their intention to leave.

* Vacancies on the committee can be filled by the MRS Study Group executive committee as needed. The person filling the vacancy will serve for the remaining duration of the original member only.

## Committee Member Duties

* The committee will maintain and curate the online resources for code/data sharing and the forum for member communications.

* Any committee member can contribute to maintaining and curating any resource. However, we will typically assign two committee members for maintaining each resource. This is intended to reduce the overall time each member has to contribute.  

* The two members should not consist of members that will rotate off the committee in the same year. This will ensure that new members have a mentor in assuming their new responsibilities.

What do we mean by ‘maintaining and curating’?  

* Maintaining means ensuring that a resource remains available and usable for its purpose. Typical actions: paying the bills, updating the underlying software, and maybe backing up the content if that is not done auto-magically. It may also mean determining if additional functionality should be added to the resource to make it work better for its stated purpose.

* Curating is trickier … it means monitoring the content of the resource to ensure that it serves the needs of the community. Typical actions: relocating an item to a more applicable location, removing an item, or warning a user for inappropriate behavior. Likely the most controversial action in curating is removal of a user for inappropriate behavior.  

* It is recommended that the more ‘serious’ actions, such as spending money on anything or the removal of a user, be discussed by and approved by at least a simple majority of the existing committee membership.
