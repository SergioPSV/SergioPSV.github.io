Ghent is home to various educational institutions, research centres and knowledge clusters and is simply a nice place to organise a conference: hospitable, charming, historical, sustainable and innovative.  In short, a city on a human scale.

Ghent is well known for its open minded people and positive attitude towards diversity and inclusivity.

### Sustainability
Cities are increasingly making efforts to limit their environmental impact. In Ghent, sustainability is more than a buzzword, it is a call for action.

As a result, discovering Ghent on foot or by bike is an absolute must! It is a city on a human scale, easily navigable by pedestrians.
