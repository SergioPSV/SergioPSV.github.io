The MRSHub is a curated collection of resources for the analysis of magnetic resonance spectroscopy data. It is maintained by the *Committee for MRS Code and Data Sharing*  of the [MR Spectroscopy Study Group](https://www.ismrm.org/study-groups/mr-spectroscopy/) of the [International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM)](https://www.ismrm.org), and was called to life at the annual ISMRM meeting in Montr√©al, Canada, in 2019.

This website wants to provide a comprehensive collection of software tools, code snippets, repositories, and other useful resources. Novice MRS users can use it as a launchpad to explore the many facets or MRS data analysis.  Experienced researchers and method developers can collaborate to build on each others efforts, and disseminate their software through a single, centralized hub.

The *Committee for MRS Code and Data Sharing* is committed to the mission of making MRS data analysis software free, open-source, well-documented, and accessible to MRS researchers of all backgrounds and levels of experience. We hope to contribute to methodological consensus and standardization, encourage collaboration and community-based development, and propel the field of MRS towards fulfilling its great potential.
