# How to access datasets

You can browse the various dataset categories by clicking on a topic in the column to the left. Each topic takes you to a list of associated datasets.

Links in each dataset entry will take you to either an external web site (typical for large-scale datasets), or to small-scale example datasets living in GitHub repositories on the MRSHub.
