## INTERNATIONAL RENAL IMAGING MEETINGS

This task force organises the bi-annual international scientific meetings on renal MRI, in cooperation with a local organising committee. 

The fourth international meeting on renal MRI will be held from 10-12 september 2021 with support of the ISMRM and will take place on two locations simultaneously: in Philadelphia and in Lisbon . 

The third international meeting on renal MRI was held in Nottingham, UK, in october 2019 and was co-organised by PARENCHIMA

The second international meeting on renal MRI was held in Berlin, Germany, in 2017 and was co-organised by PARENCHIMA .

The first international meeting on renal MRI was held in Bordeaux, France, in 2015. It predates PARENCHIMA but was attended by all PARENCHIMA participants and provided the momentum for the funding application to COST.
