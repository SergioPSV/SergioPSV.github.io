Welcome to the MRSHub!

The MRSHub is a curated collection of resources for the analysis of magnetic resonance spectroscopy data. It is maintained by the *Committee for MRS Code and Data Sharing*  of the [MR Spectroscopy Study Group](https://www.ismrm.org/study-groups/mr-spectroscopy/) of the [International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM)](https://www.ismrm.org), and was called to life at the annual ISMRM meeting in Montr√©al, Canada, in 2019.

We hope that you will find this resource useful. If you have feedback for the website or would like to contribute your skills to its maintenance, please reach out to us through the [feedback category in the MRSHub forum](https://forum.mrshub.org/c/site-feedback/2).
